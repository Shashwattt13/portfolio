# Shashwat's Portfolio Website

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, skills, and everything I’ve been working on as a developer.

**Live Site:** [https://shashwat.netlify.app](https://shashwat.netlify.app)

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure of the website  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Interactivity and dynamic content  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and code management  
- **Netlify** – Deployment and live hosting  

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
````

2. **Navigate to the project folder**

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

  * *Challenge:* Ensuring the site looks good on all screen sizes
  * *Solution:* Added responsive CSS, `<meta name="viewport">`, and tested across devices

## Next Steps
